1-The most common naming conventions are PascalCase, camelCase and kabob-case.
2- For larger projects, you want to split that stylesheet into multiple style sheets, and then combine them together. 
    This is where we use CSS preprocessor tools like sass and less.
3-Adding comments helps us logically separate different sections in our stylesheet.
4-Avoid over-specific selectors. Limit nesting to two or maximum three selectors.
5-Avoid the !important keyword as much as possible.
6-Sort Css Properties in Vscode : Select All properties => Command palette => Sort Lines ASC/DES.
7-Take advantage of style inheritance and reduce duplication in your styles.
8-We often declare variables using the :root selector that targets the html element. 
    We can then access these variables using the var() function.
9-Object-oriented CSS is a set of principles for creating reusable components. The two
    principles in object-oriented CSS are: 
    1- Separate container and content. 
    2- Separate structure and skin(btn => Structure , btn-primary or btn-secondary => Skin).
10-BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a popular naming convention for CSS classes :

    A BEM class name includes up to three parts.
    
    Block: The outermost parent element of the component is defined as the block.
    Element: Inside of the component may be one or more children called elements.
    Modifier: Either a block or element may have a variation signified by a modifier.
    
    If all three are used in a name it would look something like this:
    [block]__[element]--[modifier]
